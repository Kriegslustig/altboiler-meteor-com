Loading meteor sometimes take a long time. It is huge compared to a traditional site. For your regular mobile user (~750Kbps) it will take 6 seconds to load. This makes for an awful UX. With altboiler you can serve static HTML first and then load meteor in the background. You could for example serve a loading screen first. Or you could also preload the whole site without the parts that need a connection to the server.
